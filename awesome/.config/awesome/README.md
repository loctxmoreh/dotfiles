# AwesomeWM config

## Goals
- Self-contained: work everywhere without the rest of this dotfiles repo
    - Lua-only
    - Only resort to shell script when Lua is inappropriate
- Tag-based workflow
- Floating is secondary, but still needed

## Dependencies
- `awesome-git`
- `feh`
- `volumeicon`
- `picom`
- `nm-applet`

### Lua packages
- `tyrannical`: for tag management

## Materials
- To break down default `rc.lua` to different modules: [article](https://epsi-rns.github.io/desktop/2019/06/15/awesome-overview.html)
